## ANNA is empowering Refugees with Instant Access to Vital Information.


Imagine a tool that can help refugees get exactly the information they need. Faster and easier than Google. In their own language. And even if they canâ€™t read or write.

Introducing our App ANNA.

So, why struggle with searching on Google or relying on generic chatbots when you can have a solution tailored to your needs? Tailored for refugees. Our App combines the power of ChatGPT, with User Information and carefully researched Data. For example, about the immigration process. Because of that it can give answers with highly relevant information and even point you to the next immigration office.



## What
ANNA ensures that refugees receive accurate and practical information tailored to their specific needs, guiding them through various processes and providing them with essential resources. Even if they can't read and write.

## How
Tailored Chatbot combined with User Information and validated Data. 

## Why
Navigating the complexities of resettlement can be challenging, especially when language barriers, information overload, and illiteracy create additional hurdles. It will also take workload of social workers to make room for the important tasks.
